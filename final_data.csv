The overarching research interest is about Artificial intelligence being able to serve as a catalyst of economic and technical growth in tangential ways. When it is accompanied by powerful machines like drones, I believe It can encompass technical capabilities of billion dollar satellites. My current projects are centered around the basic concepts of intelligent systems that lay foundation for my future plans. In my recent projects, I intend to utilize ability of artificial intelligence and data science to predict the trends in stock market and recommend business new sales channels to invent on. 
My current project, "" Caelum Unlimited"" deals with the development of a AI-flown drone swarm which runs on lunar and solar energy depending on different time on the day by converting them into electricity and fulfilling its payload requirement. Using Holographic Projectors, these drones will be enable to create visualizations at a height which can be used for various purposes including advertising.
I am also engaged in the development of a highly accurate LSTM stock prediction model. Subsequently, I intend to establish a trust-based hedge fund. This fund will collect resources from willing investors and pool them for investment in stocks. The investment decisions will be based on the output generated by the LSTM model. The profits generated from these investments will be distributed among the investors.

Aside my core btech subjects, I really like to code. I was fortunate enough to start my coding journey since class 9th with Java as my first language (Strengthening it up by learning DSA). 
Now on an adventurous mission to upskill my unskilled self. Having an idea which might be a banger in reality, thus started learning App Development. 
Recently learned some web technologies too like Html and Css. 
Hardwork got mixed with a pinch of luck and won the 10th position at HACKBVP'24. Felt pretty good after performing good at my first ever hackathon :)
and became the 3rd winner at HACKVSIT 5.0
Explored some other areas too, like research and got a great opportunity to present my first research paper at an international conference last Oct.
Thankyou!",student,https://www.commudle.com/users/865e9812c78ebf6184c95fe6dff9bc1d,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",7524074140,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ananya-agarwal5501?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app,Tech
