# 🛠️ buildersspace-backend

Welcome to the **backend repo** for **Builders Space** — a student-led creative hub for developers, artists, chefs, filmmakers, and more.  
No degrees. No boring lectures. Just passion, collaboration, and a community of builders doing what they love.

This repository powers the core services of Builders Space, enabling everything from event coordination to creator profiles and collaborative tools.  
Built with love by students — for students.

## 👥 Community & Leadership

This initiative is led by a student-driven team.  
I'm currently serving as the **Backend Developer Head** and **Technical Co-Lead**, helping build and maintain the backend systems that keep the community running smoothly.
